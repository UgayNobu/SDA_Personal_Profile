## Reflection.md
(a) Documentation

Main Concepts Applied
In this project, I used the basics of front-end development: HTML for the layout, CSS (also with Tailwind) for design, and JavaScript for adding in interactivity. I focused on making the layout accessible with HTML, adding styles with CSS, and used JavaScript for effects like the circular progress bar and page redirects.
New Skills Acquired
I learned to make animated progress indicators with CSS and JS, tried out Tailwind CSS for faster styling, and figured out timed page redirects and key-based navigation.

(b) Reflection

What I Learned
This project helped me see how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript come together for an interactive layout. I got better at managing CSS with JS, especially for animations.
Challenges and Solutions
One tough part was setting up the circular progress bar, since the angles with conic-gradient were hard to get right. After a few tries, I adjusted it dynamically with JS (progressStartValue * 3.6). Another issue was the redirect delay, but I fixed it by tweaking the DOMContentLoaded event and delay timing.
